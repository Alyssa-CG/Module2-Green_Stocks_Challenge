# Module2-Green_Stocks_Challenge

#Challenge

As the Analysis shows, 2017 was, overall a more lucrative year for the twelve stocks analysed, with all but one showing positive returns. In 2018, ten out of the twelve sotcks observed had negative returns, include the DQ/DAQO stocks of particular interest to Steve and his parents.

Apologies, unfortunately, I saved the WIP as Final Version and vice versa and only now see the error as the file was still open. If there is any way to consider the file labelled WIP instead (perhaps once downloaded you can see that the file itself was last edited yesterday, well before the deadline), I would very much appreciate it as I spent quite a lot of time working on debugging it until it worked. Still, I understand if not.

Kind Regards,
Alyssa
